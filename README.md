# Why This Fork

If I ever get to it, this fork is to facilitate extration of the multiprocess and shared memory libraries out of the Hack subtree of this repo. I don't know how much longer those components are going to survive in their original repo, and I don't want to have to hunt for them later.

The two are not connected, of course - you can use the MultiWorker library separately from the SharedMem library. But, they work nicely together.

Examples to follow.
